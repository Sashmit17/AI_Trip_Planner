Check current pricing on booking sites.\n* **Transportation:** Consider using ride-sharing services (Uber/Lyft) or the public bus system to save money on transportation, especially for longer distances.  Walking is possible for many attractions on the Strip and Downtown.\n* **Food:** Pack some snacks and drinks to avoid constantly buying expensive food and drinks at tourist locations.  Look for happy hour deals at restaurants for better value.\n* **Free Activities:**  Las Vegas offers many free activities, such as exploring the Strip, watching the Bellagio fountains, and enjoying the atmosphere of the casinos.  Focus on these to stay within a budget.\n* **Image URLs:** Some image URLs are placeholders.  You'll need to search for actual image URLs for specific attractions and hotels.\n\n\nThis JSON provides a framework. You should always double-check the details (prices, opening hours, etc.) on official websites before your trip.  Remember to adapt this plan based on your preferences and available time.\n"},
